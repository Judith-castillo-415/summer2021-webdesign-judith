In the book he is described as a "German author, philosopher, adventurer, artist, and developer." The book was published on December 2015 with the publisher O'Reilly Media, Inc. The book contains thirty-seven pages. In those pages he goes over a quick outline of how coding should ideally be done.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this book, Mieret emphasizes the importance of guidelines and structure. Stating that the two most fundamental lessons he learned while coding are that coding guidelines are the cornerstore to every proffessional web development and that they ought to be followed. By creating guidelines, it allows there to be quality and consistency. With that, it aides in the areas of usability, collaboration, and maintainability. Through the book, he reapeats the importances of getting to the point and keeping it simple yet detailed. That way, the room for error can be lessen and everyone can understand. In short it baisically goes throught the purpose of following structures and why it is important. It only goes through the actual skills partially, hence, it is not the best book if you want to actually go in depth with coding. However, if you want to do a quick read and understand the importance of guidelines and why certain things are tht way they are, then this is the book for that.</P>  


<h1>Learn JavaScript with p5.js: Coding for Visual Learners</h1>
<h2>By Engin Arslan</h2>

<h2>About the Book/Summary</h2>
<p>Learn JavaScript with p5.js: Coding for Visual Learners was written by Engin Arslan. It was published by Apress on March 2018. Arslan used to work in a visual effects industry and with this experience as well as other skills Arslan learned, was able to make this 221 page book. However, like the title of the book suggests, it is written in a way that keeps the visual learners in mind. Due to this reason, I highly recommend it. Arslan starts off with why there are different languages, stating that each language has a differnet principle in mind. Some may be harder to learn but ultimately have more control of the stability and speed. According to Arslan, JavaScript is one of the easiest to learn and that it is a fullstack development. JavaScript is great to create art, design, motion, and interactive pieces. Throughout the book, it goes through terminology used and visual examples. The author goes through the structure of it and places the semicolon at the end of each statement. Arslan as well goes through certain restrictions in JavaScript. For example, you cannot use exclamation marks and dashes. Arslan's way of writing makes it engaging for the reader. The author does not discourage you, if anything Arslan pushes you to learn more languages stating it will be easier each time you learn a new one. Arslan provides you with resources that aide you to learn not only JavaScript. In the end, the author even gives you some sort of advice to help you reach your final goal and to progress in the field.
